## üéØ Example Conversation with Claude

### Question: "What caused the February 2025 blackout?"

**Claude's Response Process:**
1. üîç Calls `search_incidents("February 2025 blackout")`
2. üïê Calls `get_incident_timeline("EAF-089/2025")`
3. ‚öôÔ∏è Calls `analyze_equipment_failures()`

**Claude's Answer:**
> The February 2025 blackout (EAF-089/2025) was caused by an unexpected activation of the Siemens 7SL87 differential line protection system. Here's what happened:
> 
> **Root Cause:** The protection system's communication module failed, and during the recovery attempt, the differential line protection (87L) function had an unexpected activation.
> 
> **Equipment Details:**
> - Manufacturer: Siemens
> - Model: 7SL87  
> - Age: 6.7 years (installed May 31, 2018)
> - Risk Level: Medium Risk (approaching 7+ year threshold)
> 
> **System Impact:**
> - Total blackout affecting 11,066 MW (100% of system demand)
> - Cascade timeline: 5-second southern island collapse
> - 8 power plants affected across multiple technologies
> - Recovery varied by technology: Hydro fastest, thermal slowest

### Question: "Which companies are non-compliant with reporting?"

**Claude's Response Process:**
1. üìä Calls `get_compliance_report()`

**Claude's Answer:**
> Based on the compliance analysis, here are the companies with reporting issues:
> 
> **üî¥ CRITICAL - ENEL GENERACI√ìN CHILE S.A.:**
> - Compliance Rate: Only 7.9% (3 out of 38 reports on time)
> - Status: 92% of reports late - major regulatory risk
> - Issues: Chronic late reporting pattern
> 
> **üü° MODERATE - COLB√öN S.A.:**
> - Compliance Rate: 77.8% (14 out of 18 reports on time)  
> - Issues: Some late reports + 1 missing report
> 
> **üü° NEEDS IMPROVEMENT - INTERCHILE S.A.:**
> - Compliance Rate: 50.0% (1 out of 2 reports on time)
> - Status: Half of reports late
> 
> **Recommendation:** ENEL requires immediate attention for compliance automation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting MCP Connection

### Issue: "MCP server not connecting"
```bash
# 1. Test MCP server manually
cd "/home/alonso/Documentos/Github/Proyecto Dark Data CEN"
source venv/bin/activate
python test_mcp.py

# 2. Check Claude config path
# Ensure claude_desktop_config.json is in correct location

# 3. Verify paths in config
# Make sure all paths are absolute, not relative
```

### Issue: "Tools not appearing in Claude"
1. **Restart Claude Desktop** after config changes
2. **Check logs** in Claude Desktop (Help ‚Üí Show Logs)
3. **Verify Python environment** is activated in config

### Issue: "Database not found"
```bash
# Ensure database exists and is populated
cd "/home/alonso/Documentos/Github/Proyecto Dark Data CEN"
ls -la dark_data.db  # Should exist and be ~10KB+
python ingest_data.py  # Re-run if needed
```

## üéØ Advanced Usage Tips

### 1. **Multi-step Analysis**
```
"Analyze the complete impact of the 2025 blackout: what caused it, 
which companies were affected, what equipment failed, and what 
was the timeline of recovery?"
```

### 2. **Compliance Monitoring**
```
"Create a compliance risk report showing which companies need 
immediate attention and what the regulatory implications are."
```

### 3. **Predictive Insights**
```
"Based on the equipment failure patterns, what other equipment 
should we monitor for potential failures?"
```

### 4. **Cross-Reference Analysis**  
```
"Compare the compliance rates with the companies that had the 
most generation units affected in the blackout."
```

## üöÄ Alternative MCP Clients

If you don't use Claude Desktop, you can use:

### 1. **VS Code with MCP Extension**
```json
// .vscode/settings.json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "dark-data": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["mcp_server.py"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/project"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **Custom Python Client**
```python
# custom_mcp_client.py
import asyncio
from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client

async def ask_question(question: str):
    server_params = StdioServerParameters(
        command="python",
        args=["mcp_server.py"],
        cwd="/home/alonso/Documentos/Github/Proyecto Dark Data CEN"
    )
    
    async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
            await session.initialize()
            
            # List available tools
            tools = await session.list_tools()
            print(f"Available tools: {[t.name for t in tools.tools]}")
            
            # Example: Search for incidents
            if "search" in question.lower():
                result = await session.call_tool("search_incidents", {"query": question})
                for content in result.content:
                    print(content.text)

# Usage
asyncio.run(ask_question("What caused the blackout?"))
```

### 3. **Web Interface MCP Client**
```bash
# Start web-based MCP client
python mcp_web_client.py
# Access at http://localhost:8000
```

## üìä Monitoring MCP Usage

### Check Tool Usage Stats
```python
# Add to mcp_server.py for monitoring
tool_usage_stats = {
    "search_incidents": 0,
    "get_compliance_report": 0, 
    "analyze_equipment_failures": 0,
    "get_incident_timeline": 0
}

@server.call_tool()
async def handle_call_tool(name: str, arguments: dict):
    tool_usage_stats[name] += 1
    print(f"Tool usage: {tool_usage_stats}")
    # ... rest of function
```

Your MCP server is now ready for AI integration! Claude (or any MCP-compatible LLM) can directly query your dark data and provide intelligent analysis.
